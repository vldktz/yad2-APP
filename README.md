# Yad 2 Message Board App

this is a home assignment for Vlad katz

the app includes 2 main pages: 
1. Login page
2. Offers page

Also, a few dialogs are included:
1. new User dialog
2. new Offer dialog

Build with Angular material library and bootstrap 5

notice that a lot of code were reused from the past, or from searching the web, but I never take code I don't understand what it does.

note that the application is supposed to communicate with it back end running on localhost:3006 

the project was build on Angular V12. in order to run just hit `ng serve` and watch the magic happen.
